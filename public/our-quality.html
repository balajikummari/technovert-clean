Nothing more.</h2><p class="text-gray">Our core values evolved with us as our company grew and we learned from our experiences. They epitomise what we want to achieve and reflect in the actions, behaviors and approaches of our employees. From hiring practices, to how people work, to resolving differences of opinions, the culture defines the spirit we have created at Technovert.</p></section><section><h2>Our methods guarantee success, before it begins</h2><p class="text-gray">Well begun is half-done they say. It is even more important in Software Development. Our success lies in getting things right at the beginning.</p><div class="pt-40 pl-lg-5"><div class="py-4"><h4>Transparent from day one</h4><p class="text-gray">The first thing you will notice from the day one of our conversation is that we are open and transparent about what’s possible and what’s impractical. This allows an open dialog of possibilities.</p></div><div class="py-4"><h4>Fail fast approach</h4><p class="text-gray">We always look for the underlying assumptions and unknowns and validate them first before they could snowball into massive failures at later stages. We quickly create prototypes and reduce the risk of failures.</p></div><div class="py-4"><h4>Right architecture</h4><p class="text-gray">Architecture for us, isn’t just technology. It’s also the user experience we deliver. Our architectures therefore always starts with user-first approach. We also ensure we aren’t stereotyping ourselves to what we know and are always open and exploring what is the right tool for the problem at hand.</p></div><div class="py-4"><h4>Religiously agile</h4><p class="text-gray">We religiously apply agile sprint methodologies in every project we work and we bring in the mindset and tools to environments where our customers are not used to it.</p></div><div class="py-4"><h4>CI/CD</h4><p class="text-gray">The first thing you will notice from the day one of our conversation is that we are open and transparent about what’s possible and what’s impractical. This allows an open dialog of possibilities.</p></div></div></section><section><h2>Right mix of team based on employee engagement</h2><p class="text-gray">Our key to successful delivery is the mix of people we empower to own your projects. We always ensure there’s a right mix of team not based on the job roles but based on the strengths and behaviours - a thinker, doer, troubleshooter, binder etc. We focus on success factors of an employee in a project based on the learning, growth and the amount of challenge it puts them through. This ensures high levels of engagement for them in a project and you get the best out of them.</p></section></div></div><style>.tecnovert-vertical {
