        <h2>Our values shape the way we work and act</h2>
        <p class="text-gray">
          Our core values evolved with us as our company grew and we learned
          from our experiences. They epitomise what we want to achieve and
          reflect in the actions, behaviors and approaches of our employees.
          From hiring practices, to how people work, to resolving differences of
          opinions, the culture defines the spirit we have created at
          Technovert.

                <h2>Fanatic learning</h2>
                <p>
                  A wise man once said, if you didn’t live learning everyday,
                  you were dead long ago. In this generation of rapid evolution,
                  learning and unlearning are essential to our existence and we
                  constantly work to adapt and change our perspectives. We are
                  never wise, never great, never done. We are not afraid to make
                  mistakes or admit them. And we are not shy to learn from our
                  juniors.
                  <br /><br />
                  We see change as an opportunity to improve. Our dynamic work
                  environment frequently pushes us out of our comfort zone. Our
                  learning mindset ensures we reflect and learn from these
                  experiences to adapt quickly.
