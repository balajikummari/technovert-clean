        <p class="text-gray">
          90 percent of the people can’t even relate to the statement “Life it
          too short to do mediocre work’. Most of them die before they even
          realize. If you belong to the other 10 percent that needs purpose and
          meaning to what you do, you will find company at Technovert. We do our
          best, to make your job feel inspired, enthused and is something that
          you would look forward to doing every day, something that would push
          you out of your bed. And not make you wonder everyday when your next
          vacation is. We do have a vacation policy though and we encourage that
          employees avail it. But that’s another topic.

          Skills matter some.<br />
          Attitude matters most
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray">
          There’s one thing you will find unique about our job descriptions.
          They don’t list skills as the primary criteria. The focus is instead
          on the traits and behaviours one is expected to possess when
          performing their job. That is what makes a great professional out of
          any job role.Skills are mere tools to accomplish tasks and can be
          learnt and unlearnt any time. But the attitude you bring to the table
          when solving a problem makes all the difference and gives purpose to
          those skills and the people around you. That’s what matters to us
          most. If you like this notion we are excited and can’t wait to talk to
          you! Explore the job openings below and apply now!
