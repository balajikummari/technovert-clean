        <h2>Trust built on quality and honesty. Nothing more.</h2>
        <p class="text-gray">
          Our core values evolved with us as our company grew and we learned
          from our experiences. They epitomise what we want to achieve and
          reflect in the actions, behaviors and approaches of our employees.
          From hiring practices, to how people work, to resolving differences of
          opinions, the culture defines the spirit we have created at
          Technovert.

          Well begun is half-done they say. It is even more important in
          Software Development. Our success lies in getting things right at the
          beginning.

              The first thing you will notice from the day one of our
              conversation is that we are open and transparent about what’s
              possible and what’s impractical. This allows an open dialog of

            <p class="text-gray">
              We always look for the underlying assumptions and unknowns and
              validate them first before they could snowball into massive
              failures at later stages. We quickly create prototypes and reduce
              the risk of failures.

              Architecture for us, isn’t just technology. It’s also the user
              experience we deliver. Our architectures therefore always starts
              with user-first approach. We also ensure we aren’t stereotyping
              ourselves to what we know and are always open and exploring what
              is the right tool for the problem at hand.

        <h2>Right mix of team based on employee engagement</h2>
        <p class="text-gray">
          Our key to successful delivery is the mix of people we empower to own
          your projects. We always ensure there’s a right mix of team not based
          on the job roles but based on the strengths and behaviours - a
          thinker, doer, troubleshooter, binder etc. We focus on success factors
          of an employee in a project based on the learning, growth and the
          amount of challenge it puts them through. This ensures high levels of
          engagement for them in a project and you get the best out of them.
